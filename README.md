# BinaryFilesAssignment

This is a university assignment that I completed.

This program uses the functions to perform several operations involving GIFs such as applying effects to individual GIFs and creating animated GIFs.

The program does the following:
1.Create an Image for each of the following files: Saskatoon.gif, MoraineLake.gif,
Maracas.gif, ScarletIbis.gif, and PigeonPoint.gif.
2. Apply the grayScale effect to Saskatoon and save the Image to Saskatoon-GS.gif.
3. Apply the blueTint effect to MoraineLake and save the Image to MoraineLake-BT.gif.
4. Apply the sepia effect to Maracas and save the Image to Maracas-S.gif.
5. Apply the brighten effect to ScarletIbis and save the Image to ScarletIbis-B.gif.
6. Apply the redTint effect to PigeonPoint and save the Image to PigeonPoint-RT.gif.
7. Create an empty Animation and call it scenery.
8. Add Maracas to scenery.
9. Add MoraineLake with the blueTint effect to scenery.
10. Add PigeonPoint to scenery.
11. Add Maracas with the sepia effect to scenery.
12. Add Saskatoon to scenery.
13. Save the scenery Animation to Scenery-Animation.gif.
14. Create an empty Animation and call it random.
15. Add 7 frames to random where the frames are randomly selected from the images. The duration of each frame is randomly chosen from the range 50 to 255.
16. Save the random Animation to Random-Animation.gif.
17. Call the showWebPage function (provided in Assignment3.cpp) with “Assignment3.html”
before returning from main. If you are using a non-Windows computer, this will not work, and
you should comment this line in the code.
